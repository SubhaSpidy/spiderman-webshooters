        <li> The New Model which i have thought about is the one which is more user friendly </li>
        <li> Ppl can use it from their phone too, through an application</li>
        <li> But to build this one we need to have a good amount knowlegde about the programming languages</li>
        <li> And those are C++ and Jawascript, C++ is to run the motor and other things which are directly related to the webshooters.</li>
        <li> And Jawascript is to maintain the user friendly experience</li>
        </ol>
